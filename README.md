## Reaktor Pre-Assignment Fall 2020 - Frontend
You can read about the assignment [here](https://www.reaktor.com/junior-dev-assignment/)

I did the front end of the assignment in React Hooks. From this project I learnt what is **JSX**, **React Components** and how to use **useState, useEffect**.
The app fetches information from an API and show them. You can see how the API is built [here](https://github.com/shilena91/dpkg_status)

### Usage (in Terminal)
- Clone the repo

> git clone ht<span>tps://github.com/shilena91/reaktor2020-frontend.git && cd reaktor2020-frontend

- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```nmp start``` to start the app.
